    "## **Code Description**\n",
    "This Python code implements a basic Snake game using the Pygame library. Below is a breakdown of the code's key components and functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Initialization and Setup**\n",
    "The Pygame library is imported and initialized.\n",
    "Constants such as screen size, grid size, and game speed are defined.\n",
    "Colors for the game elements are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Screen and Graphics Setup**\n",
    "The game screen is initialized using Pygame with the specified dimensions.\n",
    "The game window's title is set to \"Snake Game.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Snake Initialization**\n",
    "The initial position and direction of the snake are defined.\n",
    "A variable to track whether the snake should grow is initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Food Initialization**\n",
    "The initial position of the food is set randomly within the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Score Keeping**\n",
    "A score variable is initialized to keep track of the player's score.\n",
    "A font for displaying the score is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Game Loop**\n",
    "The main game loop runs while the running variable is True.\n",
    "It handles events such as quitting the game and arrow key presses to change the snake's direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Snake Movement and Collision**\n",
    "The snake's movement is determined by its direction.\n",
    "Collisions with walls or the snake's own body result in a game over.\n",
    "If the snake eats the food, it grows, and a new food position is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Drawing the Screen**\n",
    "The game screen is cleared with a white background.\n",
    "The snake and food are drawn on the screen using rectangles.\n",
    "The player's score is displayed in the top-left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Game Over**\n",
    "If the game is over, a \"Game Over!\" message is displayed on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Display Update and Frame Rate Control**\n",
    "The screen is updated to show the current game state.\n",
    "The frame rate is controlled to limit the game's speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Game Termination**\n",
    "The Pygame library is properly quit, and the program exits when the game loop ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code provides a basic implementation of a Snake game and serves as a foundation for further enhancements, such as adding levels, improving graphics, or implementing additional game mechanics."
